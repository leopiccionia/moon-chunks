# moon-chunks
Some random MoonScript code chunks I've written:
* `empty.moon`: port of PHP's `empty()`, and a variation similar to Rail's `blank?()`.
* `guarded.moon`: implementation of Dijkstra's guarded commands; I tried to keep non-determinism and the rest of semantics.
    * If you think my implementation deviates from original paper, please let me know.
* `s2.compiler.moon`: a fancy Polish notation parser (works with reverse Polish notation commenting two lines); stack language wannabe.
